# User Requests (Split)

These files are a split view of the master checklist in `User_Requests.md`.

- Source of truth (for now): `User_Requests.md`
- Purpose here: easier tracking by area/screen

If you want, I can later convert `User_Requests.md` into a lightweight index that links to these files (but I kept it unchanged for now to avoid losing history).
