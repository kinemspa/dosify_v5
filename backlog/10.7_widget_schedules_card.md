# Widget — Schedules Card

## Scope
- Shared Schedules card/widget (list of schedules and navigation to schedule details).
- Currently uses `ScheduleListCard`.

## Requests
- [x] Decide whether this card should exist on Home (current Home backlog says remove it).
- [ ] If kept: show only active schedules with a clear “paused” treatment.
- [ ] Ensure schedule rows show the next dose consistently (same pattern across app).

## Recommendations
- [x] Extract a dedicated `SchedulesCard` widget to reduce page complexity.
- [ ] Add a consistent “NextDoseRow” widget and reuse across schedule cards.

## Notes
- Source backlog item: `backlog/2_home.md` → “Schedules: Remove this card”.
