# Widget — Activity Card

## Scope
- Shared Activity card/widget (filter row + activity list).
- Related widgets currently used here: `CombinedReportsHistoryWidget`, `DoseActionLegendRow`, included-meds selector.

## Requests
- [x] Make meds selection a dropdown with check marks.
- [x] Clarify what the Taken/Skipped/Snoozed/Inventory sections are for (labeling + UX intent).
- [x] Fix activity item color coding so status colors are consistent.
- [x] Remove the date icon from each activity item; show the time instead.
- [x] Group items by day with a date marker on the left (single date row + grouped items).
- [x] Add edit interaction for each activity item (this is the point of the activity log).

## Recommendations
- [x] Extract the Activity card into a dedicated widget (`ActivityCard`) to reduce page complexity.
- [x] Add empty/loading states that match the unified empty-state patterns.

## Notes
- Source backlog items: `backlog/2_home.md` (Activity section).
