# Dose Cards

## Requests

- [x] Too High.
- [x] Has time and an action to take at time. Dont need both.
- [x] Needs a date icon, will display today
- [ ] Dose instructions:
	- [x] Take X X at X.
- [ ] The take button. I am conflicted here. I want the shortcut buttons of take, snooze, skip. But also want the dialog to pop where notes can be added and the status can be changed.

## Take Dose Dialog

This is a separate UI from the Dose Card.
