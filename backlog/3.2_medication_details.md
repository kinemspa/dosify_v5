# Medication Details Screen

- [x] Minimized Cards, nudge the drag icon to the right a bit.

## MDV

### Refill
- [x] Remove the card card colour fill around stock abd new volume. 
- [x] Action: Needs helper text for each option. I dont want radio buttons. We dont use radio buttons anywhere on this app. 
- [x] Reconstitute calculator: 
    - [x] When opening the background at the top goes white. 
    - [x] When opening should init with the settings that were saved for that medication. 
- [x] Should be able to manually enter the Volume. If it is set at the init it should have helper text to inform what ahs set it. From previous Reconstitution, from new reconstitution or manually set. 
- [x] Top up needs a manual volume entry and needs to state what the current concentration is and what it would be new. SO it also needs a strenght of the top. 


### Restock

## Reconstitution Card

- [x] Saved Recon card needs to show the units calculated. 
    - [x] This is not completed. Then Card that displays is NOT showing the Units for the syringe or the syringe size. 
- [x] Editing a Recon should jump back the the current saved recon, and have the questions that pop within the calculator, not as a bottom up page. 
    - [x] This is NOT completed. It now jumps back to the recon calculator page Awesome. But the settingsa re init. not the saved settings. 
    - [x] Space behind calculator is white?

## App Header
- [x] Medication Details on a smaller resoliution screen, the Med Type badge, strenght, manufacturer, are all overlapping. Fix this. App header MUST resize to fit all elements. 
- [x] Is there a way for you to objectivelyspace all the elemnts on this section so we dont have any sizing and space issues?

## Medication Details Card


## Recommendations
- [ ] Ensure MDV stock entry flows share one concentration/units model (refill, top-up, restock).
- [ ] Add an explicit “current vs new concentration” summary row wherever volume/strength changes.
