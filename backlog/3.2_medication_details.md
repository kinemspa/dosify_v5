## Medication Details Card


## Recommendations

- [ ] Remove remaining literal styling in Medication Details UI (no ad-hoc `TextStyle(...)`, `BorderRadius.circular(...)`, `EdgeInsets.*`, `Colors.*`).
- [ ] Standardize the inline editor blocks (e.g., stock/vial editors) to use a shared card/section pattern from `lib/src/widgets/`.
- [ ] Replace any “status/toggle/chip” variants with the shared badge/chip primitives so sizing/typography matches Schedule/Home.
- [ ] Add targeted regression coverage for Medication Details (compact width + large text scale) for the header + at least 1 editor block.
