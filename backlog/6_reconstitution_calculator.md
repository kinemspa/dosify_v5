    - [x] Name, UNit and Strenght need to be included in the below section, not as part of the manage saved section.
    - [x] Medicaiton Name optional and not needed but required if saving. 
    - [x] Strenght Unit and Strenght need to be mandatory of course. Unit doesnt look like it belongs to strenght. These 2 fields should come under a heading of Strenght.
