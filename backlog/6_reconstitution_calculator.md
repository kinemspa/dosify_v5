# Reconstitution Calculator
## Requests
- [x] The Saving and Loading of Reconstitutions should be within the calcualtor. Should be able to select a saved recon from the top via drop down or create new. 
- [ ] I would think of 2 types of recons to save. One that is perforemd by the stand alone calculator, and one that is done within a Add Med or Edit Med. 
    - [ ] If saving from Add med, the medicaiton name is already set from the medicaiont parent Med. 
    - [x] If saving via the Stand Alone Calculator, the Med Name needs to be entered. 
    - [ ] I am not sure how to name them. Maybe Med Name - then strength, dose and volume. Up for recommendations here. 
- [ ] Recons that are saved to a medication need to be deleted when the parent medicaiont is deleted. 
- [ ] Recons thata re saved via stand alone and linked to a medication are not to be deleted when deleting paired medicaiotn. 
- [x] On stand alone recon calcualtor provide an option to delete saved recons. 

# Reconstitution Calculator - In Add Med Wizard

## Requests

- [x] Is not the calculator I want that is part of the Main menu. The Main menu is going to some other recon calculator. Remove that simplified one and put in the refined one. Which should be a widget. 
    - [x] This was not done. WHy do you lie to me?
    - [x] Still not Done. 
- [x] Add a “Load saved reconstitution” entry point on the main page for faster access.
- [ ] All reconstitutions that are saved via Add med need to have All settigns saved and stored. 
- [x] It should be easy to cycle through the loaded recons via the dropdown.
