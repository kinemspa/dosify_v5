# Reconstitution Calculator
## Requests
- [x] The Saving and Loading of Reconstitutions should be within the calcualtor. Should be able to select a saved recon from the top via drop down or create new. 
 - [x] You have made this on the Card, not within the calculator screen. 
- [x] I would think of 2 types of recons to save. One that is perforemd by the stand alone calculator, and one that is done within a Add Med or Edit Med. 
    - [x] If saving from Add med, the medicaiton name is already set from the medicaiont parent Med. 
    - [x] If saving via the Stand Alone Calculator, the Med Name needs to be entered. 
    - [x] I am not sure how to name them. Maybe Med Name - then strength, dose and volume. Up for recommendations here. 
- [x] Recons that are saved to a medication need to be deleted when the parent medicaiont is deleted. 
- [x] Recons thata re saved via stand alone and linked to a medication are not to be deleted when deleting paired medicaiotn. 
- [x] On stand alone recon calcualtor provide an option to delete saved recons. 
- [x] The stand alone calcualtor is some other fucking bullshit screen. It is not to be used I want the dark blue one accessible from add med or from the main menu. How hard ius this to FUCKING IMPEKMEENT YOU FUCKING PEICE OF SHIT. I HAVE EXPLAINED THIS 4000 times and you have not fixed it FFUCCCCKKKKKKQ!!!!!!

# Reconstitution Calculator - In Add Med Wizard

## Requests

- [x] Is not the calculator I want that is part of the Main menu. The Main menu is going to some other recon calculator. Remove that simplified one and put in the refined one. Which should be a widget. 
    - [x] This was not done. WHy do you lie to me?
    - [x] Still not Done. 
- [x] Add a “Load saved reconstitution” entry point on the main page for faster access.
- [x] All reconstitutions that are saved via Add med need to have All settigns saved and stored. 
- [x] It should be easy to cycle through the loaded recons via the dropdown. 
- [x] The summary card in the calculator at the bottom is not including the Med Name. Reconstitute {MEDSTRENGTH} of {MEDNAME}. It only states Med Strenght. 
    - [x] FUCK ME. Not the literal word "Medication". the fuckign medicatkions name. This is english instuction envirment wording.

# Reconstitution Calculator - Stand Alone - Main Menu
## Requests
- [x] This does not exist, it is currently navigating to an old Rec Calculator. I want this to look exactly the same as the Add med wizard one. 
- [ ] Saved Name should have Med Name, and Dose size and Volume as a default. 
- [ ] Can we compact the Load unit and Strenght fields. 
- [ ] Dont want to force users to have to save or add a med name to proceed to create a calculation. users may want to quickly jump in and have all the fields avaiable. 
- [ ]  These new fields you added, they need to have better helpwer text as this is going to confuse users, as the calculation values are already confusing. 
    - [ ] Name, UNit and Strenght need to be included in the below section, not as part of the manage saved section.
    - [ ] Medicaiton Name optional and not needed but required if saving. 
    - [ ] Strenght Unit and Strenght need to be mandatory of course. Unit doesnt look like it belongs to strenght. These 2 fields should come under a heading of Strenght.
