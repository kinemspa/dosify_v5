# Reports Card

## Requests

- [x] The Page Headings, Dont start all the way at the left. Not usre if that is intentional. 
- [x] Actions, Skipped is missing. 

### Medication Screen


### Home Screen


## Recommendations
- [x] Add a single “time range” control shared by all report cards.
- [x] Add an explicit “Skipped” state legend so colors are self-explanatory.

- [x] Implement the time range control as a shared widget (not per-screen) so Home/Medication/Analytics stay consistent.
- [x] Add tests for legend rendering + color mapping so “Skipped” remains unambiguous.
