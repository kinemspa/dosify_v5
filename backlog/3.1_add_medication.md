## Requests

- [x] Step Wizard. When selectign a field, the continue button should be a next button. then when hitting next it acts like a Tab press. Give me Next and back buttons. Once at the bottom field and something is entered, it will change to a "Continue" to move to the next page. 
    - [x] This is not working. Its still just a continue button. 
- [x] Make wizard keyboard “Next” behavior consistent via a shared form field component.
- [x] Add a final review step that highlights missing required data before save.
