# Home — Today (Up Next) Widget

## Scope
- Home screen Today / Up Next list widget (DoseCard list + hide/restore interactions).
- Includes preview/scroll behavior, Dismissible “Hide”, and entry point into Take Dose flow.

## Requests
- [ ] Rename UI copy to consistently use one label: either “Today” or “Up Next” (avoid mixed naming).
- [ ] Add a clearer “more items” indicator when the list is scrollable (arrow + subtle helper text).
- [ ] Ensure swipe-to-hide affordance is discoverable (e.g., hint the first time, or add a small action icon).
- [ ] Add an optional “Show all” action to expand the list (alternative to scrolling).

## Recommendations
- [ ] Extract this section into a `HomeTodayCard` widget to keep `HomePage` smaller.
- [ ] Add a small-width regression check to prevent DoseCard overflow/wrapping.

## Notes
- The Home backlog request “show only 3 items + scroll + arrow indicator” is tracked in `backlog/2_home.md`.
