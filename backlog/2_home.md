## Scope

## Requests
- [x] Can we remove the card outline and colour for the large cards? I would just like the headings and the objects within to be defined. 
- [x] Remove the shortcut buttons on this page. Medicaitons, Schedules, Calendar. 
- [x] Heading is not to be Dosifi v5. Maybe Home or Dashboard. 


### Up Next - Today


### Schedules

### Calendar
- [ ] Calendar is only showing the day view, needs month and week.
- [ ] Isnty updating on status changes. 

### Reports
- [ ] For reports on the home screen, the history should be 1 onject that has ALL entries in it, not multiple reports instances. 

## Notes
- 


## Recommendations
- [x] Replace Reports chips with a single “Included meds” selector (bottom sheet) to reduce clutter.
- [x] Ensure Home Schedules uses the same schedule card widget as the Schedules list for consistency.
