## Recommendations

- [x] Unify Home section card styling by exclusively using the shared card primitives (no per-section containers/decoration).
- [x] Ensure all paddings/margins on Home come from `lib/src/core/design_system.dart` tokens (no ad-hoc `EdgeInsets.*`).
- [x] Replace any “empty state” blocks with a single shared empty-state widget for consistent typography, spacing, and CTA placement.
