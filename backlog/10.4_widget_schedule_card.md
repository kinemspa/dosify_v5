# Reports Card

## Requests

- [x] The Page Headings, Dont start all the way at the left. Not usre if that is intentional. 


### Medication Screen


### Home Screen


## Recommendations
- [ ] Add a consistent “Next dose” sub-row and keep it identical across screens.
- [ ] Add a compact secondary state line (e.g., paused until, missed count) if needed.

- [ ] Create a single shared “NextDoseRow” widget and reuse it across Schedule cards, Home, and Medication details.
- [ ] Add a compact-layout regression test (small width) to prevent wrapping/overflow reappearing.
