# Home — Activity Widget

## Scope
- Home screen Activity card/widget (filter row + activity list).
- Related widgets currently used here: `CombinedReportsHistoryWidget`, `DoseActionLegendRow`, included-meds selector.

## Requests
- [ ] Make meds selection a dropdown with check marks.
- [ ] Clarify what the Taken/Skipped/Snoozed/Inventory sections are for (labeling + UX intent).
- [ ] Fix activity item color coding so status colors are consistent.
- [ ] Remove the date icon from each activity item; show the time instead.
- [ ] Group items by day with a date marker on the left (single date row + grouped items).
- [ ] Add edit interaction for each activity item (this is the point of the activity log).

## Recommendations
- [ ] Extract the Activity card into a dedicated widget (e.g., `HomeActivityCard`) to reduce HomePage complexity.
- [ ] Add empty/loading states that match the unified empty-state patterns.

## Notes
- Source backlog items: `backlog/2_home.md` (Activity section).
