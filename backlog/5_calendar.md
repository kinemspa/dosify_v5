## Requests


### Monthly View
- [x] There are now bottom overflows on every single day block. 
    - [ ] Still exists. Its a mess. 
- [x] Reduce the Day bloack rounded corners radius by half. 
- [x] Reduce the Today button rounder corners by half. 
- [x] Day numbers need to be top left of each square. Not done properly, there must be padding keeping them in the middle. 
- [x] Selected Day to fill entire block with primary colour.
- [x] Today to be filled with the light blue colour as it is with a thn primary collur border. 
- [x] Dose number indicator has too rounded corners.
- [x] Dose number indicator is too tall.  
- [x] Bottom overflow occurring on selected day. 
- [ ] Why are there numbers and markers? isnt this redundant?

### Weekly View
- [x] Day objects are too tall. Reduce them. Number is too big. Not completed. 
- [x] Dose objects on each week are styled in a way we dont see anywhere on this app. Change it. - Nothing was changed. 
    - [ ] still look the same. 

### Day View
- [x] Just extends the Dose Card Stage to full screen with the hours seton the left.
- [ ] View. It should be full screen and just show the dose card in each hour stacked vertically.


### Dose Card Stage
- [x] Need to have the Dose Stage appear like it is the Day view. Place the Hours on the left of the dose cards like the day view. 
    - [ ] There is too much space on the left of the time. I want it very small and fully left aligned to allow the dose card to take up most of the screen.
    - [ ] Place the hour bove the cards instead of the side, that way the dose cards can be full width. 
- [ ] Dont need a close button. What is it closing?
- [x] Need scroll down indicator. 
    - [ ] This is too prominent, reduce its size. 
- [x] Stage needs to extend down to bottom of page. Its currently stopping above the FAB. 
    - [ ] Was not completed. FAB needs to hovering over the top. 
- [x] Needs some padding between the Calendar, currently huggin the bottom border of calnedar.
    - [ ] Something is wrong here. WHy cant you fix this, there is a wierd backgorund colour making this look like a card withn a card. WTF?
