# Calendar

## Requests

### Monthly View

### Weekly View


### Day View
 

### Dose Card Stage
- [x] This is draggable up and down, but only when dragging from the bottom part of the stage, there is the little drag icon, when selecting that it doesnt allow the drag. 
- [x] Dose card stage top needs to be hugging the bottom of the calendar boundary. Also should snap to that. So we should have a init snap to bottom of calendar boundary, drag it up it goes full screen, drag it down it hides with a tab showing at the bottom to show it can be dragged up.
