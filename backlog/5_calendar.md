# Calendar

## Requests
- [x] Allow dragging the Dose stage up so it becomes full screen. 
    -[x] This does not work. 
- [x] There is a little bit of space underneath the monthly view and the dose stage, waste of space, make the dose stage always hug and touch the bottom of the monthly, weekly view. 

### Monthly View
- [x] Days boxes are now way to big vertically. 
- [x] There are no markings fo the doses on the days. 

### Weekly View


### Day View
- [x] Lets put very light dividers between each day. 
 

### Dose Card Stage
- [x] Need to have the Dose Stage appear like it is the Day view. Place the Hours on the left of the dose cards like the day view. 
    - [x] There is too much space on the left of the time. I want it very small and fully left aligned to allow the dose card to take up most of the screen.
    - [x] Place the hour bove the cards instead of the side, that way the dose cards can be full width. 
- [x] Dont need a close button. What is it closing?
- [x] Dont need a close button. What is it closing?
- [x] Need scroll down indicator. 
    - [x] This is too prominent, reduce its size. 
- [x] Stage needs to extend down to bottom of page. Its currently stopping above the FAB. 
    - [x] Was not completed. FAB needs to hovering over the top. 
- [x] Needs some padding between the Calendar, currently huggin the bottom border of calnedar.
    - [x] Something is wrong here. WHy cant you fix this, there is a wierd backgorund colour making this look like a card withn a card. WTF?


## Recommendations
- [ ] Add visual regression tests for month/week grids (overflows are easy to reintroduce).
- [x] Consider unifying Day View + Dose Stage layout code to avoid divergence.
