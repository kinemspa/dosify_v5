# Schedule Details

## Requests


### App Header
- [x] Schedule Details Heading at the top of the header, like the meidcaiont details screen. 
    - [x] Schedule Name is to be where Schedule Details is currently. Scrolls to top when scrolling down like the med details screen. Make identical. 
- [x] Move the right column items to the right.
- [x] Status to not be status and Active, make it the same badge as the cards. 
- [x] There is a today and an active badge that are slightly there. look very transparent. 
- [x] Lots of wasted space at the bottom of app ehader gradient. App Header gradient should always scale to fit.


### Schedules Details
- [x] Heading is not primary
- [x] Edit Dose, needs to pop a dialog that matches the Add Scheduel Wizard. Currently just allows a dropdown of all med unit types. this is a failure. 
- [ ] Editing. We do not want to go to the wizard for editing. We need dialogs for eveyr single edit. 


### Schedules Card
- [x] Doesnt nEeed to include the Saved Schedules. This is inside the saved Schedule. Redundant. This entier card may not be required here. What are your thoughts?



## Recommendations
- [x] Reuse the Add Schedule wizard UI as the single editor surface (avoid parallel editors).
- [x] Add a clear “Pause/Resume schedule” affordance only if it exists globally.
