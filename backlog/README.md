# User Request Docs

This folder contains user request notes and the split checklist files.

- [x] The split files here are for easier tracking by area/screen

- [x] Completion method: use markdown checkboxes only (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`).
- [x] Do not use `[COMPLETED]` tags (they are redundant).
- [x] Template: `backlog/TEMPLATE.md`

- [x] Note: Some files in this folder may be intentionally untracked (draft notes).


## Recommendations
- [ ] Capture new ideas in a dedicated “Recommendations” section (unchecked) before implementation.
- [ ] Prefer small, per-screen requests and avoid mixing unrelated items in one checkbox.
