# Reports (Analytics, Inventory, Export)

## Analytics

### Requests
- [ ] This will have the same widgets as the medicaiont details screen but it will allow for viewing data from all meds and schedules. It will also allow for exporting of data.

## Inventory

### Requests
- [ ] A new screen that provides a high level of all stock.


## Recommendations
- [ ] Start with read-only aggregated widgets reused from Medication Details, then add Export (CSV) as v1.
- [ ] Inventory overview: show per-med stock gauges + “days remaining” summaries with consistent cards.
