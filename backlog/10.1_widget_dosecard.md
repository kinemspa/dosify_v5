# Dose Card
This will be a working document for the Dose Card Widget.

## Requests

- [x] Status badge to be the same size for statuses.
- [x] Add snapshot coverage (goldens) for the Dose Card states to prevent regressions.
- [x] Card styling to be the same as all the other cards.the background shadow is showing through since there is no fill. Make it the same as the other cards. 
- [x] The status badge is fucken borked now. Why did you fuck it so bad? Its too wide, its not heigh neough, the objects are not centred
- [x] Dose Text. Too big. I dont want it to wrap. Or put each value on its Own line. 
- [x] Too much space between Dose Heading and Med name. 
- [x] Make the date and time bold text. 
- [x] Dose cards need to not expand too high. I want them compact. 




## Usages



## Recommendations

- [x] Centralize status badge sizing + padding in a single shared widget/token so all states render consistently.
- [x] Remove any hard-coded colors/padding/radii inside the Dose Card widget and migrate to design-system tokens.
- [x] Add/extend golden coverage for compact layouts (max-height / no-wrap dose text) to prevent regressions.
