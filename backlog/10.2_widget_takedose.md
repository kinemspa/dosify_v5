# Take Dose Dialog

## Notes
- This will be a working document for the Take Dose dialog widget.


## Requests
- [x] I think the dialog card approach for this is not the right one, as it allows for less real estate. I would like to change the take dose dialog to a bottom page. Make sure its all styled the same way. 
- [ ] 
- [x] Dose Card needs to be full width fo dialog. 
- [x] Add “quick presets” (common syringe sizes) to reduce taps.
- [x] Validate and clamp unit precision consistently (avoid decimals where impossible).
- [ ] Dose Card to be full width of dialog. looks too compressed. 
- [ ] MDV:
    - [x] Syringe graphic to be directly under dose card. 
- [x] Cannot tell that there is more screen to scroll down. 
- [x] Too much padding between take dose headding and help text and same agin to dose card. 
- [x] Helper text "Press Save and CLose"  ? Really? Press? better helper text then pelase. 
- [x] The 4 status buttons, they look awesome in colour, but they dont fit well on the screen in terms of layout. Lots of wasted space. Is there any other way to do this and make it look cleaner?
- [x] Way too much padding on the sides of the dialog. wasted space. 
- [x] Date Icon, when taken to change to a tick.
- [x] Make tick a thicker looking tick.

### Tablets

### Capsules

### Single Dose Vial

### Pre Filled Syringe

### Multi Dose Vial

- [x] Syringe  graphi is not full width nor centre aligned
- [x] Dose change, need to be able to change from units, strenght, volume. Alos need to be able to change the syringe size
- [x] Dose change needs to reflect on the syringe graphic


## Recommendations

- [x] Define presets (common syringe sizes) centrally (single source of truth) and reuse across all dose-entry surfaces.
- [x] Move unit-precision clamp rules into a shared helper/service so Tablet/Capsule/MDV/PFS all behave identically.
- [ ] Add widget tests for presets + precision clamp + scroll affordance (these are easy to regress with layout tweaks).
