# Add Schedule
- [x] When changing to strenght, can we not abruptly nudge the entire screen. Can there be an easier way to ease the new menu item in?
- [x] All card headings have grey text headings. Should be primary colour. 
- [x] Where is helper text supposed to appear? ABove or below the field it is attached to. It seems inconsistent on this. 

## Step 1
- [x] Too much unused space below the Select Medication text. 
- [x] Incremental arrows and field are not using our style. {Seems like it is done for tablets screen. not the rest}
- [ ] Remove trailing 0 in summary card.
- [ ] Change summary card font to primary for the numbers. 
- [x] Tablets:
	- [x] The forumal summary field below only appears once entering data. Why? EveryDose type should have an init amount relative to the medicine. Make sure the forumal display field is there always. Popping things in and out is visually jarring. It also moves the screen around.
	- [x] Shortuct buttons have the wrong border colour. Make it the same as everything else.
	- [x] Incremental field Centre align it in the card.
	- [x] Helper text needs to sound professional and consistent (avoid overly casual phrasing like "We'll convert").
	- [x] Why soo much spcae underneeth the doe type field?
	- [x] Appheader Text Needs to have the = for the dose caclualtion. Currnet has Dose: 2 tablets (bullet) 100mg. Should be 2 tablets = 100mg

- [ ] MDV:
	- [x] Change Syringe to Syringe Size. 
	- [x] Change hekper text to something like. Select the syringe size used for administration. 
	- [ ] Dose Input mode:
		- [ ] change to a drop down. 
		- [x] Dose Input mode helper text. Somethign like "Select a method to calculate your dose."
		- [ ] When strenght is selected. Have helper text to display how the strenght and dose is calculated. 
		- [ ] When Volume is selected. Have helper text to display how the dose is calculated. 
		- [ ] When Units is selected. Have helper text to display how the dose is calculated. 
	


## Step 2
- [ ] Schedule Pattern:
	
	- [x] The Type helper text is below the Type row, then the helper text for the below things is above meaning these helper texts are confusing. 
	- [x] Dropdown textin the field needs to be reduced. 
	- [x] Days of the Week:
		- [x] Helper text " Days of the Week: Select the days of the week for doses" Reword this professionally. 
	- [ ] Days on / Days off:
		- [x] Helper text " X Days on, X Days off: Enter the number of days to take a dose and then the number of days to not take a dose. This will repeat until schedule end." Reword professionally. 
	- [ ] 
	- [x] Days of the Month
		- [x] How can we handle something like, First monday of every month, or first 2 mondays of every month? How do other task apps approach this?
			- Proposed UX: add a "Monthly (Nth weekday)" schedule pattern that lets users pick ordinal(s) (1st/2nd/3rd/4th/Last) + weekday(s).
			- Examples: "First Monday" = 1st + Monday. "First two Mondays" = 1st + 2nd + Monday.
			- Behavior: if a month doesn't contain the selected ordinal (e.g., 5th Monday), either skip or treat as last occurrence (needs a setting).
			- Note: this needs new Schedule fields + occurrence logic (not implemented yet).
			- [ ] Proceed with the above. 
			- [ ] App header summarry is displaying numbers like 3, 15, 18 (bullet) 9:00 AM. Needs to display the Type aswell. Also this row of text is left aligned but since it is below the icon it is wrapping all the way to the left. Need it to line up with its above text in the same elft alignment. 

## Step 3
- [x] Summary:
	- [x] Dose needs to show the following:
		- [x] Go and find out the correct terminology for dosing medications. What I care about is framing the correct terms for Say, if a dose is 1 tablet, the tablet is called what?, then we have the strenght of medicaiont in the tabletm what is that called? Same with a capsule, this is like the medicaiont carrier or form. Then if its a single dose vial, we would have the Dose in Volume, the Dose in Strenght, and the DOse in the delivery or admiinstration mechanism, which would be a syringe for this one. These values need to be displayed evetrywhere on the app where these things appear. As this app is to communicate very specifically the details here. If I am using a pre filled syringe, I want the Med Strenght, the Med Volume and the Amount of the measurement in teh administation tool/ method. So go find the correct terminology for this so we can write it in as a rule for you to adhere to across this app.
	- [x] Cannot Save schedule now. Save Schedule is just allowing the press of the button but nothing changes on screen.  
	- The active Add Schedule route is `/schedules/add` and it opens `AddScheduleWizardPage`.
	- A legacy `AddEditSchedulePage` still exists in code but is not the main routed flow.
	- [ ] Remove the legacy add edit schedule screen. I dont want any remaining junk code here to confuse.
