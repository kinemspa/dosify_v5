# Home — Calendar Widget (Mini)

## Scope
- Home screen embedded mini calendar (`DoseCalendarWidget` in mini variant).
- Focus: selection behavior, day-view drill-in, and displaying dose cards when a day is selected.

## Requests
- [ ] When a day is selected, display dose cards for that day (Home backlog request).
- [ ] Ensure the mini calendar selection state is obvious (selected day styling).
- [ ] Provide a quick “Open full calendar” action.

## Recommendations
- [ ] Reuse the same selected-day dose-card stage behavior between mini and full calendar variants where possible.
- [ ] Add a compact empty state for days with no doses.

## Notes
- Source backlog item: `backlog/2_home.md` → “Calendar: Needs to display the dose cards when a day is selected.”
