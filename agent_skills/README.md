# Agent skills (Dosifi v5)

This folder contains short, reusable “skills” that describe how an agent should work in this repo.

## Skills

- [Flutter change workflow](skill_flutter_change_workflow.md)
- [Design system compliance](skill_design_system_compliance.md)
- [Backlog-driven delivery](skill_backlog_driven_delivery.md)
- [UI overflow/constraint debugging](skill_ui_overflow_debugging.md)

## Notes

- These skills are intentionally procedural and repo-specific.
- If you want these in a different location/format (for a specific agent framework), tell me which one and I’ll adapt them.
