- Calendar header: moved month label below the view selector and nav arrows to improve hierarchy and readability.
- Global compact mode: applied compact visual density, shrunk tap targets, and reduced default paddings for ListTiles, inputs, and buttons.
- Back navigation: ensured Add/Edit Supply page shows a back button.

- Captured full product design in docs/product-design.md.
- Added tracking system to avoid context loss when we pivot:
  - docs/backlog.md (Now/Next/Later)
  - docs/status.md (current focus & paused threads)
  - docs/journal.md (this file) for ongoing notes
  - scripts/dev/status.ps1 to summarize repo and open items
- Decision: Deprioritize OS notifications until core UX modules (Supplies, Calendar, Schedules polish) are done. See docs/notification_scheduling_investigation.md for current state and next steps.
