# Architecture

This document will grow with the implementation. Initial notes:

- Layers per feature: data, domain, presentation
- State: Riverpod Notifiers
- Navigation: go_router with typed route names
- Storage: Hive boxes per aggregate (planned)
- Notifications: flutter_local_notifications with timezone (planned)
