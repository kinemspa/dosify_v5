# Selection Screens UX

Status: Active

- Primary-colored selection buttons now include leading icons and support text to reduce visual emptiness and improve scannability.
- Each screen includes a small header describing what to do.

Screens
- Select Medication Type
  - Header: Add a medication — Choose the type so we can tailor the fields for you
  - Buttons: Tablet (icon: medication), Capsule (icon: medication_liquid), Injection (icon: vaccines)
- Select Injection Type
  - Header: Select injection type — We’ll tailor fields for the syringe or vial you use
  - Buttons: Pre-Filled Syringe (icon: vaccines), Single Dose Vial (icon: science), Multi Dose Vial (icon: science)

Spacing
- Increased list padding (top/bottom) and 16px vertical gaps between options.
- Buttons have 14px inner vertical padding.

Rationale
- Maintain strong primary visual identity while adding affordances (icons, guidance) to avoid a barren look.
