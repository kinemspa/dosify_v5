# Things To Fix

## Global
- Hamburger nav menu has vanished from all the app headers across the app. [COMPLETED]



## Home Screen


==============

## Medication Screen
- Filters and sorting. I need to be able filter on any filed and then sort on it. The Buttons are perfect, just need them to work better. [COMPLETED]
- Search - Needs to prioritise Medname first, then Manufacturer, then description. [COMPLETED]
- Seacrh results font is too dark.  [COMPLETED]
- All cards/lists have different text colours for the Med Name. Make the med name primary colour for all. 

### Large Cards
- Large Cards are a bit too spacious, how can we compact them a bit.  [COMPLETED]
- Large Cards MDV we can change the x/x reserve vials, change it to x sealed vials.  [COMPLETED]

### Compact Cards
- Need to be restyled to be more in line with the app style [COMPLETED]

### List
- Make the list items less tall [COMPLETED]

==============

## Medication Details Screen
- The text under the DOnut graph, it needs some better alignment and styling. It looks not great. 

### Reports Card
- We need to have a more compact wat to display the history. 
- What other graphs can we add?

### Medication Details Card
- Restyle the entire card. Make it look nice. The dialog cards on this screen are something to go by. 
- Font is black. 
- MDV Backup Stock - We need to unify the terminology across the app for this. We had reserve vials, sealed vials backup stock. Pick the best terminology for this and stikc with it. 
- MDV Backup Stock - restock button is way too big.
