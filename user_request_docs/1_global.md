## Requests

- [x] Text across entire app. there is a colour that is dark grey for alot of text in sporatic places. I dont want this dark text. It is too abrubt on the eye. I want a consistent colour. of grey, not dark. Across the Entire App. Ive tried to communicate this 100s of times and you still code text in this dark grey almost black colour. STOP IT!!!!!! FIX IT!!!!!
- [x] Deleting a Medication.
	- Warngin Dialog needs to state. Deleting a medication will delete all associated schedules. But will maintain and historical data. 
	- Deleting Medication must delete schedules, all futere schduled doses and associated notifications. Currently Is not doing this. 

- Text sizes:
	- Write here in this file all the text sizes in use. I feel there is no uniformity of all text sizes across the app.

- You have made the Schedule Cards and Dose cards the same thing. This is WRONG. Doses are a sub componant of a schedule. Schdeule cards which we already had on the Schedule screen, show all the settings of the Schedule. DOse Cards just show the information of the Dose.
