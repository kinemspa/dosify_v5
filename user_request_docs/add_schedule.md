# Add Schedule

- [ ] When changing to strenght, can we not abruptly nudge the entire screen. Can there be an easier way to ease the new menu item in?

## Step 1
- [ ] Text "Set Per DOse amount. You can fine tune it later if needed." WHat is this text I never asked for this. There is no fine tuning later section.
- [ ] Tablets:
	- [ ] The forumal summary field below only appears once entering data. Why? EveryDose type should have an init amount relative to the medicine. Make sure the forumal display field is there always. Popping things in and out is visually jarring. It also moves the screen around.
	- [ ] Shortuct buttons have the wrong border colour. Make it the same as everything else.
	- [ ] Incremental field Centre align it in the card.

## Step 2
- [ ] Schedule Dates card and Patter card are touching. Also headings need to be primary colour.
- [ ] Schedule Pattern:
	- [ ] Days of the Week:
		- [ ] Day selection chips. Inactive Chips are too active looking. maybe reduce the border.
	- [ ] Days of the Month
		- [ ] How can we handle something like, First monday of every month, or first 2 mondays of every month? How do other task apps approach this?

## Step 3
- [x] These cards need to have the same heading styling as all other large cards.
- [x] Summary:
	- [x] Dose needs to show the following:
		- [x] Go and find out the correct terminology for dosing medications. What I care about is framing the correct terms for Say, if a dose is 1 tablet, the tablet is called what?, then we have the strenght of medicaiont in the tabletm what is that called? Same with a capsule, this is like the medicaiont carrier or form. Then if its a single dose vial, we would have the Dose in Volume, the Dose in Strenght, and the DOse in the delivery or admiinstration mechanism, which would be a syringe for this one. These values need to be displayed evetrywhere on the app where these things appear. As this app is to communicate very specifically the details here. If I am using a pre filled syringe, I want the Med Strenght, the Med Volume and the Amount of the measurement in teh administation tool/ method. So go find the correct terminology for this so we can write it in as a rule for you to adhere to across this app.
- [ ] Settings:

- [ ] You have stated all the below items are completed. None of them are. Are we dealing with a different add schedule screen? Are there multiple? Is there a different one that is not in the route?
