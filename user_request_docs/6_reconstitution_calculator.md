# Reconstitution Calculator

## Stand Alone - Recon Calc
- [x] This is a stand alone version of the recon calculator used in the Add Med MDV wizard. I want it to be exactly the same as that one in an operations perspective. The only difference is that you will have the ability to enter a manual medicaiont name and medicaiont strenght.
- [x] The standalone one will allow for the saving of reconstitution calculations. Which can be opened up and viewe and editied, and or sourced in the add med wizard.
- [x] This should be the one accessible from the hamburger menu.
- [x] The Reconstitution Calculator that is selectable from the Main Menu, is supposed to show the dsame recon calculator as in the Add MEd Screen MDV.

- [x] Has the option to add a med name in it.
- [x] Requires a med strength.
- [x] Allows for saving of reconstitotions.
- [x] You had supposedly done all of the above, but its not what is accessible or routable from the main menu. [COMPLETED]
