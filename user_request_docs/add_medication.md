- The above task is still not complete. The continue button is supposed to be a next button to jump to the next field easily while the OSK is displaying. Must be for ALL wizards. [COMPLETED]
- Above Task is still not complete. You changed the continue button to be Next. Great.But it still jumps to the next step. It needs to jump through the fields on the current step. Once at the last field, it then changes to continue. This is so users can fill all the fields on the screen without havign to minimize the OSK to click on the next field to fill out. [COMPLETED]
